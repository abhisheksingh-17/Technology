## Code Description

The Technology Stack Section project is organized into several key components that work together to create an interactive technology stack display. Below is a brief description of each significant component:

1.HTML Structure: The project begins with an HTML5 structure that defines the layout of the web page. It includes sections for the tabbed navigation, the container for displaying technology stacks, and placeholders for adding technologies.

2.CSS Styling: CSS3 is used for styling the web page, including defining the appearance of tabs, technology boxes, and responsive design elements. The project's responsive design ensures that it looks great on various screen sizes.

3.JavaScript Interactivity: JavaScript is responsible for adding interactivity to the web page. It enables users to click on tabs to filter and display technology categories dynamically. The showTechnologies and hideOtherTechnologies functions control the visibility of technology stacks.

JS Code Description-

```javascript
function showTechnologies(section) {
    // Get all elements with class 'tab'
    const tabs = document.querySelectorAll('.tab');
    
    // Remove the 'active-tab' class from all 'tab' elements
    tabs.forEach(tab => tab.classList.remove('active-tab'));

    // Find the specific 'tab' element related to the provided 'section'
    const activeTab = document.querySelector(`.tab.${section}`);

    // Add the 'active-tab' class to the selected 'tab' element
    activeTab.classList.add('active-tab');

    // Get all elements with class 'technologies'
    const technologies = document.querySelectorAll('.technologies');
    
    // Remove the 'active' class from all 'technologies' elements
    technologies.forEach(tech => {
        tech.classList.remove('active');
    });
}

```

Now, let's break this code down into paragraphs and points to explain it more clearly:

1.Function Definition: The code defines a JavaScript function named showTechnologies which takes a single argument called section. This function is responsible for showing a specific section of technologies based on the provided section argument.

2.Selecting All Tab Elements:

 - The first step within the function is to select all elements with the class tab using the document.querySelectorAll('.tab') method.

 - These elements represent the tabs that allow users to switch between different sections of technologies.

3.Removing Active Tab Class:

 - Next, a forEach loop is used to iterate through all the selected tab elements.

 - For each tab element, it removes the class active-tab using the classList.remove('active-tab') method. This ensures that no tab is currently marked as "active."

4.Selecting the Active Tab:

 - The code then uses the provided section argument to construct a CSS selector (e.g., .tab.section-name) to select the specific tab associated with the provided section.

 - This selected tab element is stored in the activeTab variable.

5.Adding Active Tab Class:

 - To indicate that this tab is currently active, the code adds the active-tab class to the activeTab element using classList.add('active-tab').

6.Selecting All Technology Sections:

 - Similarly, the code selects all elements with the class technologies (representing sections of technologies) using document.querySelectorAll('.technologies').

7.Removing Active Class from Technology Sections:

 - Another forEach loop is used to iterate through all the selected technology sections.

 - For each section, it removes the active class using classList.remove('active'), ensuring that no technology section is currently marked as "active."

In summary, this function is responsible for updating the interface when a user clicks on a specific tab. It removes the "active" state from all tabs and technology sections, adds the "active" state to the clicked tab, and ensures that the corresponding technology section is displayed.

```javascript
const technologiesSection = document.querySelector(`.technologies.${section}`);
technologiesSection.classList.add('active');
hideOtherTechnologies(section);
```
Now, let's explain this code in a paragraph and point format:

1.Selecting the Technology Section:

 - In this part of the code, a specific technology section is selected based on the provided section argument.

 - It constructs a CSS selector using template literals (`) to target an element with the class technologies followed by a dot (.) and the specific section name.

 - The selected technology section is stored in the technologiesSection variable.

2.Adding the Active Class:

 - The code adds the class active to the technologiesSection using classList.add('active').

 - This class is responsible for making the selected technology section visible on the web page.

3.Calling the hideOtherTechnologies Function:

 - After adding the active class to the selected technology section, the code calls the hideOtherTechnologies function and passes the section argument to it.

 - This function is responsible for hiding all other technology sections on the page, ensuring that only the selected section is displayed as "active."

In summary, this part of the code is responsible for selecting and displaying the specific technology section associated with the clicked tab, making it visible on the web page. It also triggers the hideOtherTechnologies function to hide other sections, ensuring that only one section is active at a time.

```javascript
function hideOtherTechnologies(sectionToKeep) {
    const allTechnologies = document.querySelectorAll('.technologies');
    allTechnologies.forEach(tech => {
        if (!tech.classList.contains(sectionToKeep)) {
            tech.classList.remove('active');
        }
    });
}
```
Now, let's explain this code in a paragraph and point format:

1.Selecting All Technology Sections:

 - The function begins by selecting all elements with the class technologies using the document.querySelectorAll('.technologies') method.

 - These elements represent all the technology sections on the web page.

2.Iterating Over Technology Sections:

 - It then uses the forEach method to iterate through each of these technology sections.

 - For each technology section, it executes the provided callback function, which is defined using an arrow function.

3.Checking for Active Status:

 - Within the callback function, it checks whether the current technology section's class list does not contain the sectionToKeep argument.

 - This check is performed using the !tech.classList.contains(sectionToKeep) condition.

4.Removing the Active Class:

 - If the condition is met (i.e., the section is not the one to keep), it removes the active class from the technology section by calling tech.classList.remove('active').

 - This step effectively hides the technology section from the web page.

In summary, the hideOtherTechnologies function is responsible for hiding all technology sections on the web page except for the one specified by the sectionToKeep argument. It achieves this by removing the active class from sections that are not meant to be displayed, effectively hiding them from view.

The project's codebase is designed to be well-structured and modular, making it easy to understand and maintain. Developers can extend and customize the project by adding their own technology entries or modifying the code to suit their needs.
